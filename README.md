**DUEDARE**: Dense Urban Environment Dosimetry for Actionable Information and Recording Exposure

Code to accompany (unpublished) paper: Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-fine Scales. This work uses an ultra-fine, holistic environmental and biometric sensing paradigm to generate empirical particulate matter models estimated by biometric variables. 

Scripts are written using MATLAB R2021b. Additionally, this work is built on top of the biometrics research library BM3: https://github.com/mi3nts/BM3. All relevant functions from BM3 are explicitly included in this repository.
