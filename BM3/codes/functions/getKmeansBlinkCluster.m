% FUNCTION TO LABEL BLINKS USING MINIMUM DISTANCE TO KMEANS CLUSTERING 
% CENTROIDS ON EYE IMAGES COLLECTED WITH TOBII PRO GLASSES 2 

% INPUTS:
%     img = GRAYSCALE IMAGE OBJECT. 960Ã—240x1.
%     C = CENTROIDS FOR EACH KMEANS CLUSTER (E.G. EYE CLOSED, OPEN,
%     PARTIAL, ETC.)
%     bias = NUMERICAL ARRAY. MANUAL BIAS TO PUSH POINT IN PIXEL SPACE
%     TOWARD A GIVEN CLUSTER. NOTE: POSITIVE VALUES "PUSH" POINT CLOSER AND
%     NEGATIVE VALUES "REPEL" POINT AWAY FROM CLUSTERS.

% NOTE: Heuristic to get which centroid corresponds to eyes closed or open
% or other. Sum centroid coordinates in grayscale pixel space. Larger sums 
% correspond to eyes open since the scelera is white.
